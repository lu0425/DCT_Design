## Overview

This project implements a 1D (One-Dimensional) 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) using Verilog HDL. The 1D DCT is a fundamental signal processing operation that transforms time-domain or spatial-domain signals into the frequency domain.
The 1D DCT performs transformation on a sequence of N points, converting the input signal into frequency domain coefficients. It is widely used in audio compression, speech processing, and as a building block for 2D DCT in image compression.

### Mathematical Expression
The following figure shows the architecture of expanding the DCT formula using a matrix.

  <p><i>Figure: 1D 8-point DCT matrix representation</i></p>
</div>

The matrix equation is:
```
Z = C × X
```

Where:
- `X = [x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅, x₆, x₇]ᵀ` is the input vector
- `C` is the 8×8 DCT coefficient matrix
- `Z = [z₀, z₁, z₂, z₃, z₄, z₅, z₆, z₇]ᵀ` is the output (DCT coefficients)
- `θ = π/16`

### Key Features

- **8-point 1D DCT**: Transforms 8 input samples into 8 frequency coefficients
- **Optimized Architecture**: Uses symmetry properties of DCT matrix to reduce multiplications
- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: 8-bit (7-bit + 1 sign bit) coefficient representation
- **Hardware Efficient**: Exploits anti-symmetry to minimize computational complexity

### Design Approach

The implementation leverages the **symmetric and anti-symmetric properties** of the DCT coefficient matrix to reorganize computations:
```
Traditional Matrix Multiplication:
64 multiplications (8×8)

Optimized Approach:
32 multiplications (50% reduction)
```

By factoring out common coefficients and pre-computing differences like `[X(0) - X(7)]`, the design significantly reduces hardware multiplier count.

```
θ = π/16

c1 = cos(θ)    = cos(π/16)
c2 = cos(2θ)   = cos(2π/16)
c3 = cos(3θ)   = cos(3π/16)
c4 = cos(4θ)   = cos(4π/16) = cos(π/4) = 1/√2

## Method

The design methodology consists of four main steps: coefficient bit-width calculation, coefficient conversion, algorithm optimization, and Verilog implementation.

### ◆ Step 1: Coefficient Bit-Width Calculation

**Objective**: Determine the minimum bit width required to achieve SQNR ≥ 40 dB.

<div align="center">
  <img src="media/sqnr_analysis.png" alt="SQNR vs Bit Width" width="600"/>
  <p><i>Figure: SQNR analysis for different coefficient bit widths</i></p>
</div>

#### Process:
1. Generate random test input: `X = randi([0,256], 8, 100000)` (100,000 test vectors)
2. Compute floating-point reference: `Z = C × X`
3. For each bit width L (from 1 to 15):
   - Quantize coefficients: `C_f = floor(C × 2^L) / 2^L`
   - Compute quantized output: `Z_f = C_f × X`
   - Calculate error: `Error = Z - Z_f`
   - Compute SQNR: `SQNR(L) = 10 × log₁₀(signal / noise)`
4. Plot SQNR vs. bit width

**Result**: 
- **8-bit** (7-bit + 1 sign bit) achieves **SQNR ≈ 43.7 dB**
- Meets the target specification of SQNR ≥ 40 dB
- Provides good balance between precision and hardware cost

### ◆ Step 2: Coefficient Conversion to Binary

Convert floating-point DCT coefficients to 8-bit fixed-point binary representation.

<div align="center">
  <img src="media/coeff_conversion.png" alt="Coefficient Conversion" width="500"/>
</div>

#### MATLAB Code:
```matlab
s = pi/16;
c1 = cos(s);
c2 = cos(2*s);
c3 = cos(3*s);
c4 = cos(4*s);
c5 = cos(5*s);
c6 = cos(6*s);
c7 = cos(7*s);

a = [c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7];

for i = 1:numel(a)
    binaryCoeff = dec2bin(floor(a(i) * 2^8), 8);
    fprintf('%s\n', binaryCoeff);
end
```

**Output** (8-bit binary coefficients):
```
11111011  (c1)
11101100  (c2)
11010100  (c3)
10110101  (c4)
10001110  (c5)
01100001  (c6)
00110001  (c7)
```

**Note**: MATLAB's `dec2bin` uses one's complement representation, which may introduce minor quantization differences in verification.

### ◆ Step 3: Algorithm Optimization

**Key Insight**: The DCT coefficient matrix exhibits **symmetric and anti-symmetric properties**, allowing us to reorganize the computation to reduce multiplications.

<div align="center">
  <img src="media/optimized_equations.png" alt="Optimized DCT Equations" width="700"/>
  <p><i>Figure: Reorganized DCT equations exploiting symmetry</i></p>
</div>

#### Original Matrix Form:
Each output requires 8 multiplications:
```
z₀ = x₀×c4θ + x₁×c4θ + x₂×c4θ + x₃×c4θ + x₄×c4θ + x₅×c4θ + x₆×c4θ + x₇×c4θ
```

#### Optimized Form:
By exploiting symmetry (coefficients appear with opposite signs):
```
Y(0) = [X(0) + X(1) + X(2) + X(3) + X(4) + X(5) + X(6) + X(7)] × P

Y(1) = [X(0) - X(7)] × A + [X(1) - X(6)] × B + [X(2) - X(5)] × C + [X(3) - X(4)] × D

Y(2) = [X(0) - X(3) - X(4) + X(7)] × M + [X(1) - X(2) - X(5) + X(6)] × N

Y(3) = [X(0) - X(7)] × B + [X(1) - X(6)] × (-D) + [X(2) - X(5)] × (-A) + [X(3) - X(4)] × (-C)

Y(4) = [X(0) - X(1) - X(2) + X(3) + X(4) - X(5) - X(6) + X(7)] × P

Y(5) = [X(0) - X(7)] × C + [X(1) - X(6)] × (-A) + [X(2) - X(5)] × D + [X(3) - X(4)] × B

Y(6) = [X(0) - X(3) - X(4) + X(7)] × N + [X(1) - X(2) - X(5) + X(6)] × (-M)

Y(7) = [X(0) - X(7)] × D + [X(1) - X(6)] × (-C) + [X(2) - X(5)] × B + [X(3) - X(4)] × (-A)
```

**Coefficient Mapping**:
```
A = c1 = cos(θ)
B = c3 = cos(3θ)
C = c5 = cos(5θ)
D = c7 = cos(7θ)
M = c2 = cos(2θ)
N = c6 = cos(6θ)
P = c4 = cos(4θ)
```

#### Computational Savings:

| Method | Multiplications | Advantage |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Direct Matrix** | 8 × 8 = 64 | Straightforward |
| **Optimized** | 4~8 per output, ~32 total | **50% reduction** |

**Benefits**:
1. ✅ Reduces number of hardware multipliers needed
2. ✅ Pre-computes differences (e.g., `X(0) - X(7)`) only once
3. ✅ Reuses intermediate results across multiple outputs
4. ✅ Minimizes critical path delay

### ◆ Step 4: Verilog RTL Implementation

The Verilog implementation directly maps the optimized equations into hardware.

  <p><i>Figure: Verilog RTL code snippet</i></p>
</div>

#### Implementation Structure:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
    if (~rst) begin
        // Reset all outputs to 0
        z0 <= 21'b0;
        z1 <= 21'b0;
        // ... (z2~z7)
    end
    else begin
        // Compute optimized DCT equations
        z0 <= (xx0 + xx1 + xx2 + xx3 + xx4 + xx5 + xx6 + xx7) * c4;
        z1 <= (xx0 - xx7)*c1 + (xx1 - xx6)*c3 + (xx2 - xx5)*c5 + (xx3 - xx4)*c7;
        z2 <= (xx0 - xx3 - xx4 + xx7)*c2 + (xx1 - xx2 - xx5 + xx6)*c6;
        z3 <= (xx0 - xx7)*c3 + (xx1 - xx6)*(-c7) + (xx2 - xx5)*(-c1) + (xx3 - xx4)*(-c5);
        z4 <= (xx0 - xx1 - xx2 + xx3 + xx4 - xx5 - xx6 + xx7)*c4;
        z5 <= (xx0 - xx7)*c5 + (xx1 - xx6)*(-c1) + (xx2 - xx5)*c7 + (xx3 - xx4)*c3;
        z6 <= (xx0 - xx3 - xx4 + xx7)*c6 + (xx1 - xx2 - xx5 + xx6)*(-c2);
        z7 <= (xx0 - xx7)*c7 + (xx1 - xx6)*(-c5) + (xx2 - xx5)*c3 + (xx3 - xx4)*(-c1);
    end
end
```

**Key Implementation Features**:
- Uses 8-bit coefficients (c1~c7) defined as parameters
- 21-bit output width to accommodate accumulation without overflow
